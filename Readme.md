# Ilmenite Olark
Integrates live chat application Olark with your WordPress site with full localization support.

Adding your Olark code to your WordPress site is really easy. We wanted a straight and reusable way of configuring the chat box across all of our sites and offering localization support.

For this reason, we created this little Olark WordPress plugin to save our and others' time when adding translated chat boxes from Olark. In a future plugin version, we aim to support custom texts too.

We thank Olark for recommending this plugin for installing their chat box to your WordPress website.

This plugin was created by Erik Bernskiold at Bernskiold Media [http://www.bernskioldmedia.com].

## Installation & Configuration
This plugin is available from the WordPress plugin repository.
Alternatively, you can download the master repository here and upload to your plugins folder. Rename the plugin folder 'ilmenite-olark'.

The plugin works out of the box with minimal settings. Visit the settings page after installation and activation to add your Olark Site ID and activate the chat box and localization support as desired.
