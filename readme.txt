Integrates live chat application Olark with your WordPress site with full localization support.

== Description ==
Adding your Olark code to your WordPress site is really easy. We wanted a straight and reusable way of configuring the chat box across all of our sites and offering localization support.

For this reason, we created this little Olark WordPress plugin to save our and others\' time when adding translated chat boxes from Olark. In a future plugin version, we aim to support custom texts too.

This plugin was created by Erik Bernskiold at Bernskiold Media [http://www.bernskioldmedia.com].

= Translation =
Included in the package are translations for the following languages:

- English
- Swedish

A complete *.pot* file is available in the *translations/* directory. If you use and translate this little plugin, please send us the translation so it can be included!

= Support =
We provide minimal support for this plugin, but we are happy to take requests and are commited to fixing bugs. Please report them in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/bernskioldmedia/ilmenite-olark/issues

== Installation ==
This plugin is available from the WordPress plugin repository.
Alternatively, you can download the master repository here and upload to your plugins folder. Rename the plugin folder `ilmenite-olark`.

The plugin works out of the box with minimal settings. Visit the settings page after installation and activation to add your Olark Site ID and activate the chat box and localization support as desired.
